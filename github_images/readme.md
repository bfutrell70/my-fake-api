Coffee images were in the format https://lili.io/H8Y78Qt.webp.

The above URL was from one of the videos in the Angular HTTP Playbook course. Of course it doesn't work as of November 14, 2025.

I saved images for the issue reported at https://github.com/ArvidGardebo/fake-coffee-brand-api/issues/26 
since they contain the data shown on the coffee bag's label. I also saved the hero image on the project's site.
